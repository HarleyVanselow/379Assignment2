Project 2

Hi Kdan,

I'm going to work on the server this weekend. Timeline wise, I think we'll probably need to work monday and tuesday evening on this,
as I'm totally busy thursday and friday.

Hopefully we can get *most* functionality done this weekend, work on the integration on monday, and go the the lab on tuesday with
whatever truly puzzling stuff comes up.
